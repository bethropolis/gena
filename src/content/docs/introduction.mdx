# what is gena?
It is a ready template to help you get strarted writting documentation as quick as possible.

It is built with `Astro` + `tailwindCSS` + `mdx`

## getting started

### installation
Read the [installation guide](./installation).

### configuring the sidebar

the left sidebar is configuration is on the `src/content.ts` file. <br/>
edit the file in order to change the content of the sidebar.

```ts
// src/content.ts
export const sidebarStructure = [
  {
    label: "Getting Started",
    children: [
      {
        label: "introduction",
        path: "./docs/introduction",
      },
      {
        label: "installation",
        path: "./docs/installation",
      },
    ],
  }
];
```
<br/>
configuring the right sidebar happens in the markdown/mdx file in the `content` folder.

example `content/docs/introduction.mdx`.


```md
---
title: "Introduction"
outline: ["getting-started", "installation"]
---

rest of the markdown...
```
<br/>

### adding content

To add more content to the template, just add more `markdown\mdx` files to the `content/docs` directory.<br/> 
The routing is done automatically by
Astro, [read about router here](https://docs.astro.build/core-concepts/routing/).

note:
> To change it from the docs directory you'll have to change `src/content.ts`
```js
export const docsDir = "docs";
```
<br/>
